# PrimapePrediction Documentation - Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

PrimapePrediction is a multi-outcome prediction market platform built on the Arbitrum One blockchain. The platform uses pari-mutuel mechanics where bets are pooled and winnings are distributed proportionally, ensuring fair and transparent payouts. The documentation site not only assists users in understanding how to use and interact with the platform, but also gives developers clear insights into the underlying smart contracts, SDK usage, and integration patterns.

This project is being built to provide a comprehensive resource that serves both new and experienced users. Its key objectives are to simplify the onboarding process, clarify the platform’s technical concepts, and offer detailed developer guidelines. Success for PrimapePrediction Documentation is measured by how easily users can understand and navigate the documentation, and how effectively developers can integrate with and build upon the platform.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   A fully functional, responsive Next.js-based documentation website.

*   Detailed documentation pages such as:

    *   Home Page with an introduction to the platform.
    *   About Page containing mission, features, and technology stack explanations.
    *   Quick Start Guide for onboarding users.
    *   Connect Wallet Page explaining how to connect Ethereum wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet) configured for Arbitrum One.
    *   Developer-specific pages covering smart contract details (functions, view functions, events) and SDK integration.

*   Features like ChatGPT integration for interactive Q&A with documentation content.

*   Documentation search functionality.

*   Theming options (light and dark mode).

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Core prediction market platform functionality (i.e., creating and managing markets) is not covered beyond documentation.
*   Building the actual blockchain backend smart contracts or the betting engine.
*   Full-scale mobile apps or multiple frontends beyond the documentation site.
*   Advanced UI customizations beyond the standard theming support provided by Tailwind CSS and Radix UI components.
*   Non-documentation related user interfaces or dashboards.

## 3. User Flow

A typical user starts at the Home Page, where they are greeted with a concise introduction to PrimapePrediction and its key features. From here, they can navigate to the About Page to learn more about the platform’s mission, technology stack, and core functionalities. New users can also jump directly to the Quick Start Guide, where a step-by-step process encourages them to connect their Ethereum wallet and configure it for Arbitrum One.

For developers, the journey continues with easy-to-follow sections dedicated to understanding the smart contracts and SDK. After reading through the detailed explanation of functions like createMarket, buyShares, and claimWinnings, developers can access the SDK page which provides instructions for installation, usage, and error handling. The interactive ChatGPT integration and search capability allow users to quickly get answers to their queries, ensuring a smooth and effective learning experience.

## 4. Core Features

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend:**

    *   **Next.js:** The React framework powering the documentation site.
    *   **TypeScript:** Strictly-typed programming language to enhance reliability and code quality.
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the site.
    *   **Radix UI:** Unstyled UI components for creating accessible and flexible interfaces.

*   **Blockchain:**

    *   **Arbitrum One:** An Ethereum layer-2 solution that hosts the blockchain aspects of the platform.

*   **SDK & Integration:**

    *   **@primapeprediction/sdk:** The dedicated SDK that provides a simplified integration for developers interacting with the smart contracts.
    *   **ChatGPT:** Integrated AI queries to assist users with documentation-related questions.

*   **Deployment & Tools:**

    *   **Vercel:** A cloud platform for deploying the Next.js application.
    *   **Windsurf, Cursor, Replit, VS Code, V0 by Vercel:** IDEs and plugin tools to support AI-powered coding and contemporary design patterns.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**\
    The documentation site should load quickly and be responsive on all devices. Aim for page load times under 2 seconds for optimal user experience.
*   **Security:**\
    Ensure secure handling of any user interactions, even though the main focus is documentation. Use best practices for interacting with blockchain wallets and sensitive data. Conduct periodic security reviews especially for developer-accessible pages detailing smart contract functions.
*   **Usability:**\
    The interface must be clear with intuitive navigation. The search and ChatGPT-integrated Q&A features must be easily accessible and fast, ensuring users can efficiently find the information they need.
*   **Compliance:**\
    Follow standard web accessibility guidelines (WCAG) to make sure the documentation is accessible to all users. Use secure networking practices and HTTPS for data integrity.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**

    *   The project relies on the availability and stability of Arbitrum One.
    *   The ChatGPT integration depends on access to the AI model and may be subject to API rate limits.
    *   The SDK and smart contracts documentation assume that the smart contracts are pre-audited and maintained.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   Users and developers accessing the documentation will have a basic understanding of blockchain technology.
    *   The documentation is targeted for users familiar with standard Ethereum wallets and network setup procedures.
    *   The environment used for development (IDE tools such as Windsurf, Cursor, Replit, VS Code) supports modern coding practices and integrations as specified.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits:**\
    The ChatGPT integration might face rate limits, affecting the speed or ability to answer documentation queries. Mitigation includes caching popular queries for faster responses.
*   **Browser Compatibility:**\
    Ensure that the Next.js frontend is thoroughly tested across all major browsers. Tailwind CSS and Radix UI should work seamlessly, but there might be subtle discrepancies in older browsers.
*   **Smart Contract Updates:**\
    Changes or updates in the smart contracts could render parts of the documentation outdated. Maintain a versioning system for documentation to keep track of updates and communicate clearly when changes occur.
*   **Blockchain Network Issues:**\
    As the platform is built on Arbitrum One, any network-specific issues or downtime could impact user trust even if only the documentation is affected. Regular monitoring and fallback messaging can help mitigate user anxiety during downtime.
*   **User Onboarding Hurdles:**\
    Complexities with wallet connections (network settings, compatibility issues) might lead to user confusion. Detailed step-by-step guides along with troubleshooting tips are essential.

This document provides a clear, structured foundation for understanding the PrimapePrediction Documentation project. It ensures that all aspects—from user experience to technical integration details—are well-defined for any subsequent technical documentation and development phases.

# PrimapePrediction Documentation App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a brand-new user visits the PrimapePrediction Documentation site, the journey starts at a welcoming landing page that introduces the platform and its core features. Although the documentation does not require a traditional sign-in process for reading content, users who wish to interact with enhanced features such as ChatGPT integration, personalized themes, or saved preferences can register or use social login options if these advanced features are enabled in the future. In cases where a user opts for account creation, the flow guides them through providing basic credentials, verifying their email, and setting up their profile. Additionally, if a returning user needs to regain access, a straightforward link for password recovery is available, ensuring that any lost credentials can be securely reset. The sign-out process is equally intuitive, allowing users to safely exit the interactive portions of the site while maintaining a smooth experience across all pages.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon entering the site, users are greeted by the Home Page, which acts as a central dashboard for the entire documentation experience. This page provides a concise introduction to PrimapePrediction and outlines its key features such as multi-outcome markets, pari-mutuel mechanics, adjustable fees, and integrated developer tools. Prominent navigation menus across the top and within a sidebar allow users to easily jump to sections such as the About Page, Quick Start Guide, Connect Wallet Page, Smart Contracts information, and SDK integration guides. The interface is designed for clarity and ease of movement, ensuring that users always know their current location within the documentation and how to access additional resources without confusion.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

As users navigate into the detailed sections of the documentation, they follow a logical flow that connects each page seamlessly. Starting at the Home Page, a user interested in learning more can click through to the About Page which deep dives into the project’s mission, its underlying technology, and core functionalities. From the About Page, users looking to get started can easily access the Quick Start Guide that provides a step-by-step introduction to platform usage, ensuring that even newcomers can quickly understand the basics. An essential part of this flow is the Connect Wallet Page, where users receive clear instructions for linking their Ethereum wallet using popular options such as MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, or Trust Wallet, with guidance to properly configure the wallet for the Arbitrum One network. Beyond user onboarding, the documentation caters specifically to developers. They are directed to the Smart Contracts Page which details contract functions like createMarket, buyShares, and claimWinnings along with important events. Further, developers can move on to the SDK Page where instructions for installing and using the @primapeprediction/sdk are provided. Throughout these transitions, the navigation elements like headers, search bars, and footer links ensure that moving from one detailed page to another is smooth and logically connected.

## Settings and Account Management

Users and developers have the option to manage various settings throughout their interaction with the documentation site. A prominent settings area, typically accessible via a header icon or a dedicated settings page, lets users change visual preferences such as switching between light and dark modes. This area might also include options for managing search preferences, toggling the ChatGPT integration for interactive Q&A, and subscribing to updates if account features are enabled. Account management tools allow registered users to update personal information, adjust notification settings, and review their account details easily. These settings are designed in a way that users can navigate back to the main documentation flow without losing context, ensuring the experience remains integrated and user-friendly.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

In any robust documentation system, it is essential to handle error states and alternative user journeys gracefully. Users encountering incorrect URLs or broken links are directed to a custom error page that explains the problem clearly and provides navigational cues back to the Home Page or other relevant sections of the documentation. If a user enters invalid data during an account setup or wallet connection process, contextual error messages appear, guiding them to correct the issue with specific instructions. Similarly, should there be a temporary loss of connectivity or issues with the ChatGPT integration, fallback pages and informative alerts are displayed to reassure the user and provide steps for trying the action again later. These mechanisms ensure that even when something goes wrong, the user can quickly recover and continue with the documentation journey without undue frustration.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The overall flow of the PrimapePrediction Documentation site is designed to offer a cohesive and friendly experience from the very first visit through to regular use. New visitors begin at the welcoming landing page and are gradually introduced to the platform’s core concepts and features. Whether they are learning about the project through the About Page or diving deeper into technical details via the Smart Contracts and SDK pages, every step of the process is clearly linked through intuitive navigation and well-defined page transitions. The integration of interactive elements such as ChatGPT and comprehensive error handling further ensures that users have the support they need at all times. Ultimately, the documentation experience is structured to empower users and developers alike to confidently explore and interact with PrimapePrediction, from initial onboarding to managing detailed account settings and beyond.
